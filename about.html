          Greetings! <br /> <br />

          As a software engineer, I became fascinated by the concept of machines gaining intelligence through learning. I immersed myself in the intricate systems and algorithms that make this possible and found the architecture and engineering behind them to be captivating. Throughout this journey, my focus will be on learning about new and intriguing systems and algorithms, as well as exploring and creating them. I will also document my experiences and thoughts in detail. <br /> <br />

          I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, feedback, or any suggestions you may have. Additionally, if there are any specific resources you'd like to share with me or draw my attention to, please feel free to do so.
